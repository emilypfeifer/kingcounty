Using the O-SEMN framework (Obtain, Scrub, Explore, Model, iNterpret), I dive deep into the King County housing dataset.

## The Data
The King County dataset consists of housing data on about 215,000 houses sold between May 2014 and May 2015 and their sale prices. The dataset also includes several variables such as number of bedrooms, number of times the house was viewed before being bought, square footage of the home, and the zipcode that the house is located in. You can view the dataset by opening the file `"kc_house_data.csv"`, in this repository.

## Goal

The purpose of this project is to find out which independent variables (i.e. square footage, year built, etc.) have the most predictive power in determining the sale price of a home.

## Questions

In pursuit of my goal for this project, I asked a series of behavioral questions about what influences home buyers the most when looking for a house. A few of the questions are as follows:

* Will people be more likely to buy a waterfront home when the weather is nice?
* Which do people value more, the number of bathrooms a house has or the number of bedrooms a house has?
* Which zipcodes or geographical areas have the highest number of homes sold?
